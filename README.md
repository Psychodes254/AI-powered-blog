# AI-Powered Blog

A minimal, lightweight blog built with Next.js and Markdown, scaffolded and enhanced entirely by an AI CLI agent.

## What We Built

This project is a fully functional blog that renders posts from local Markdown files. It features a simple, clean interface with syntax highlighting for code blocks.

### Who It's For

This project is for developers and tech enthusiasts interested in exploring the capabilities of AI-driven development workflows. It serves as a practical example of how to leverage an AI agent for scaffolding, feature implementation, testing, and documentation.

### How to Run

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ai-powered-blog
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The blog will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

### Why It Matters

This project demonstrates a novel approach to software development, where an AI agent acts as a pair programmer, taking high-level instructions and translating them into code, configuration, and documentation. It showcases the potential for AI to accelerate development, automate repetitive tasks, and assist in creating robust applications.

## Tech Stack

*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Framework:** Next.js
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with the Typography plugin
*   **Markdown Processing:** `markdown-it` for rendering and `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting.
*   **Testing:** Jest, configured for a Next.js environment with TypeScript.

## AI Integration Strategy

This project was developed using an AI CLI agent. The following sections detail how AI was leveraged throughout the development process.

### Code Generation

The AI agent scaffolded the entire project and generated new features based on natural language prompts.

*   **Project Scaffolding:** The agent initiated the project using `npx create-next-app` with specific flags for a minimal TypeScript and Tailwind CSS setup. When this process failed due to environment issues, the agent adapted by using a Vercel starter template.

*   **Feature Implementation:** New features were added through prompts. For example, the `MarkdownRenderer` component was created with the prompt: "Add a `MarkdownRenderer` component that:- Takes markdown text as input- Converts it to HTML- Applies syntax highlighting to code blocks- Uses [remark / markdown-it / markdown2]". The agent chose `markdown-it` for its robustness and extensibility.

### Testing

The testing setup and initial test files were generated by the AI agent.

*   **Test Setup:** When prompted to "Write tests for the actions and add a “test” script", the agent added `Jest`, `ts-jest`, and other required dependencies to `package.json`, and created the necessary `jest.config.js` and `jest.setup.js` files.

*   **Test Generation:** The agent wrote unit tests for the data fetching logic in `src/lib/posts.ts`. It automatically mocked the `fs` module to isolate the tests from the file system, demonstrating an understanding of testing best practices.

### Documentation

The AI agent is capable of generating and maintaining project documentation.

*   **README Generation:** This `README.md` file was generated by the AI agent based on a prompt detailing the required structure and content.

*   **Docstrings and Comments:** The agent can be prompted to add docstrings to functions and comments to complex code blocks to improve readability and maintainability. For example, comments were added to the `MarkdownRenderer` component to explain the dependencies.

### Context-Aware Techniques

The AI agent uses context from the user's environment to make informed decisions and debug issues.

*   **File System Awareness:** The agent uses tools to read file content (`read_file`) and list directory structures (`list_directory`). This allows it to understand the existing codebase, adhere to conventions, and diagnose problems. For instance, when `create-next-app` failed silently, the agent listed the directory contents to confirm that essential files like `package.json` were missing.

*   **Error Analysis:** The agent can analyze error messages from shell commands to understand what went wrong and formulate a recovery plan. When `npm test` failed, the agent could have analyzed the `ENOENT` error to understand that the command was run from the wrong directory.

*   **Iterative Refinement:** The agent can refine its work based on user feedback. When told that the `MarkdownRenderer` component was "not finished", the agent analyzed the component, identified potential improvements (like adding styling), and provided an updated version.

## Features Implemented

*   **Blog Post Rendering:** Converts Markdown files from the `_posts` directory into HTML pages.
*   **Dynamic Routing:** Generates a unique page for each blog post based on its filename.
*   **Syntax Highlighting:** Applies syntax highlighting to code blocks within blog posts using `highlight.js`.
*   **Homepage:** Displays a list of all blog posts with summaries.
*   **Responsive Design:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive layout.
*   **Theme Switcher:** A dark/light mode theme switcher.

## Technologies Used

*   **Next.js:** A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **Markdown-it:** A Markdown parser for converting Markdown to HTML.
*   **highlight.js:** A syntax highlighter for code blocks.
*   **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework.

## Notes on AI Usage

The development of this blog was heavily reliant on an AI CLI agent. The agent was used for a variety of tasks, including:

*   **Scaffolding the project:** The initial Next.js project was set up by the AI.
*   **Implementing features:** The AI wrote the code for rendering Markdown, creating dynamic routes, and building React components.
*   **Writing tests:** The AI generated the Jest configuration and wrote unit tests for the application's data-fetching logic.
*   **Debugging:** The AI helped diagnose and fix errors encountered during development.
*   **Documentation:** This README file was created and updated by the AI.

The AI agent's ability to understand natural language prompts, interact with the file system, and execute shell commands was crucial to the successful completion of this project.
