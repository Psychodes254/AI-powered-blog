# AI-Powered Blog

A minimal, lightweight blog built with Next.js and Markdown, scaffolded and enhanced entirely by an AI CLI agent.

## What We Built

This project is a fully functional blog that renders posts from local Markdown files. It features a simple, clean interface with syntax highlighting for code blocks.

### Who It's For

This project is for developers and tech enthusiasts interested in exploring the capabilities of AI-driven development workflows. It serves as a practical example of how to leverage an AI agent for scaffolding, feature implementation, testing, and documentation.

### How to Run

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ai-powered-blog
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The blog will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

### Why It Matters

This project demonstrates a novel approach to software development, where an AI agent acts as a pair programmer, taking high-level instructions and translating them into code, configuration, and documentation. It showcases the potential for AI to accelerate development, automate repetitive tasks, and assist in creating robust applications.

## Tech Stack

*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Framework:** Next.js
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with the Typography plugin
*   **Markdown Processing:** `markdown-it` for rendering and `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting.
*   **Testing:** Jest, configured for a Next.js environment with TypeScript.

## AI Integration Strategy

This project was developed using an AI CLI agent. The following sections detail how AI was leveraged throughout the development process.

### Code Generation

The AI agent scaffolded the entire project and generated new features based on natural language prompts.

*   **Project Scaffolding:** The agent initiated the project using `npx create-next-app` with specific flags for a minimal TypeScript and Tailwind CSS setup. When this process failed due to environment issues, the agent adapted by using a Vercel starter template.

*   **Feature Implementation:** New features were added through prompts. For example, the `MarkdownRenderer` component was created with the prompt: "Add a `MarkdownRenderer` component that:- Takes markdown text as input- Converts it to HTML- Applies syntax highlighting to code blocks- Uses [remark / markdown-it / markdown2]". The agent chose `markdown-it` for its robustness and extensibility.

### Testing

The testing setup and initial test files were generated by the AI agent.

*   **Test Setup:** When prompted to "Write tests for the actions and add a “test” script", the agent added `Jest`, `ts-jest`, and other required dependencies to `package.json`, and created the necessary `jest.config.js` and `jest.setup.js` files.

*   **Test Generation:** The agent wrote unit tests for the data fetching logic in `src/lib/posts.ts`. It automatically mocked the `fs` module to isolate the tests from the file system, demonstrating an understanding of testing best practices.

### Documentation

The AI agent is capable of generating and maintaining project documentation.

*   **README Generation:** This `README.md` file was generated by the AI agent based on a prompt detailing the required structure and content.

*   **Docstrings and Comments:** The agent can be prompted to add docstrings to functions and comments to complex code blocks to improve readability and maintainability. For example, comments were added to the `MarkdownRenderer` component to explain the dependencies.

### Context-Aware Techniques

The AI agent uses context from the user's environment to make informed decisions and debug issues.

*   **File System Awareness:** The agent uses tools to read file content (`read_file`) and list directory structures (`list_directory`). This allows it to understand the existing codebase, adhere to conventions, and diagnose problems. For instance, when `create-next-app` failed silently, the agent listed the directory contents to confirm that essential files like `package.json` were missing.

*   **Error Analysis:** The agent can analyze error messages from shell commands to understand what went wrong and formulate a recovery plan. When `npm test` failed, the agent could have analyzed the `ENOENT` error to understand that the command was run from the wrong directory.

*   **Iterative Refinement:** The agent can refine its work based on user feedback. When told that the `MarkdownRenderer` component was "not finished", the agent analyzed the component, identified potential improvements (like adding styling), and provided an updated version.
